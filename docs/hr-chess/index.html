    <h2>High Roller Chess Rules</h2>
    <p>This game follows most of the same rules of chess. However, <i>when you want to capture a piece</i>, you must specify which piece you are moving, then roll the die.</p>
    <p>The number shown on the die is the <i>maximum</i> number of times that piece can move.</p>
    <p>You may then move that piece, and your turn ends once you make a move that does <i>not</i> capture an opponent&rsquo;s piece, or when you reach the maximum number of moves for that turn.</p>
    <h2>About the Embedded Chess Board</h2>
    <p>This is a freeplay chess board with multiplayer functionality; you move pieces without the typical chess board restrictions and connect with others by creating and joining rooms.</p>
